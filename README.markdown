# GithubPropertiesLister
## What's this?
This is an adroid application just for my practice.
Input the user name and push the submit button,
then the names of Github Project names of that user will be listed below.

|Input a username of github and push the Submit button|Project names of that user are listed|

## Motivation
I had a technical interview the other day at some company,
and I was asked such a product IN ONE HOUR.
Fortunately I could create an application,
but it was written in Java8 (not Kotlin),
LinearLayout (not ConstraintLayout),
ListView (not RecyclerView),
no binding (no butterknife),
no Rx (no RxAndroid),
no using resources (strings.xml).
I'd like to write more fluently.
I created this project for my revenge (but for hours).
